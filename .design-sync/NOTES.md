# ReachKit design-sync notes

ReachKit is a **Next.js app**, not a packaged component library — no Storybook,
no compiled component `dist/`, no `exports`. The standard package-shape converter
cannot run. We **hand-author** the Claude Design layout from standalone, adapted
versions of the app's components.

## Pipeline (proven)
- Component sources: `.design-sync/ds-src/*.tsx` — clean, prop-driven React, no
  Next/server/data coupling, styled with inline styles + `var(--c-*)` tokens.
- Bundle: `node .design-sync/ds-src/build.mjs` → `ds-bundle/_ds_bundle.js`
  (IIFE → `window.ReachKitDS`). React is **external**, resolved to the vendored
  global the preview cards load.
- **JSX gotcha**: the repo tsconfig sets `jsx: react-jsx` (automatic runtime),
  which esbuild picks up and emits `require("react/jsx-runtime")` → crashes in
  the browser. Fixed by passing `tsconfigRaw` with `jsx: "react"` (classic) in
  build.mjs so the bundle needs only the React global.
- React 19 dropped UMD, so `_vendor/` ships **React 18 UMD** (unpkg) for preview
  rendering — fine for these simple components.
- Tokens: `ds-bundle/tokens/tokens.css` (full `--c-*` light+dark + fonts via
  Google Fonts @import); `styles.css` @imports tokens + `_ds_bundle.css`.
- esbuild lives in `.ds-sync/node_modules`; `.design-sync/node_modules` is a
  symlink to it so build.mjs resolves esbuild (recreate per clone:
  `ln -sfn ../.ds-sync/node_modules .design-sync/node_modules`).

## Status
- Project: "ReachKit Design System" (819c77dc-3b5b-42e1-a065-315f28ee4f0b).
- Foundations + 6 signature components built & bundle render-verified:
  BrandMark, Button, Badge, ScoreGauge, ScoreCard, ComparisonTable.

## Re-sync risks
- The bundle is hand-built, NOT from a published dist — it can drift from the
  app's real components. Treat ds-src as the DS's own source of truth.
- Fonts load from Google Fonts at runtime (`[FONT_REMOTE]`), not shipped woff2.
