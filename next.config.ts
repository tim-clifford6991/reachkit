// file plan: typed config; `serverExternalPackages` for the Supabase admin
// client; no `ignoreBuildErrors` and no `ignoreDuringBuilds` — a build that
// hides a type error defeats the pins-first CI order BP-005's NFR budget
// states, so neither key is set (their default is `false`).
// ADR-002 / REQ-001 c8 (issue #13): "Every response from /scan/{domain} —
// report, removal line, malformed line, refusal, cooldown, progress —
// carries `noindex` as both a meta tag and an `X-Robots-Tag` header, and
// no sitemap the product publishes names a report address." The meta half
// is the route's own `metadata` export; this is the header half, declared
// here rather than in `src/middleware.ts` so the authorisation allow-list
// keeps one job. It applies to every response the path produces, the 308
// included, which is what "every response" asks for.
//
// One value, now on two sources: `/veto/:token` (issue #144) carries a
// single-use stop token in its path, and an indexed one is a stop link
// published to everyone. Hence the name is the header's, not the report's.

// ── Issue #331: the response headers every ReachKit-served byte carries ──
//
// Four of the five headers this issue names are the same on every request,
// so they are declared here, where they reach *everything* the deployment
// serves — the routed responses, the `/_next/static` bundles and the
// favicon alike. `src/middleware.ts` never sees those last two (its
// `matcher` excludes them on Next's own recommendation), which is why this
// is the right home for a fixed header and the wrong one for a per-request
// value.
//
// **The fifth, the CSP, is not here, and cannot be.** The issue asks for a
// *nonce-based* policy: a fresh, unpredictable `'nonce-…'` per request, so
// that the only inline script a browser will run is the one this server
// emitted. `headers()` is evaluated once, at build, for every request
// alike, so a nonce written here would be a constant — which is to say not
// a nonce at all. Next's own guide puts it in the proxy for exactly this
// reason ("Proxy enables you to add headers and generate nonces before the
// page renders", `01-app/02-guides/content-security-policy.md`), and the
// renderer reads the nonce back off the *request* header the proxy set
// (`next/dist/server/app-render/app-render.js`, `parseRequestHeaders`).
// So `src/middleware.ts` owns the CSP — including its `frame-ancestors` —
// and this file owns `X-Frame-Options`, that directive's legacy twin,
// which does reach the static bundles.
//
// Every value below is internal (rule 1.1): a header's wire name and its
// attributes. None is a sentence anybody reads, so none is a copy key.
